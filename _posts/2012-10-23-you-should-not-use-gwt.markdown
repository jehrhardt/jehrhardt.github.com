I have done some development with
[GWT](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/) in the past. It felt
pretty natural to me as a Java developer, but I would not choose it
anymore. The primary benefit of GWT was, I could use Java instead of
JavaScript to do web development. But replacing a language made for
the web with a laguage forcing you to write all this useless
boilerplate code is not a solution.

GWT abstracts the web and the browser in a way similar to JSF and
other frameworks I would not recommend. Instead I would choose some
technology embracing the web. Doing pure JavaScript is the best way to
be close enough to the browser.

If you do not like JavaScript's syntax, you should try CoffeeScript or
even LispyScript but not Java. From a Java developers point of view,
this might be a hard topic. You know your IDE and neither CoffeScript
nor JavaScript integrate as well into it as Java does. But it is never
to late to learn programming without a
[walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_\(mobility\)).
