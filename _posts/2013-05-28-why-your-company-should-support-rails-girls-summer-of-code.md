If you are software developer and you look around yourself in the
office, you will probably see a lot of men sitting around you. It is
no secret, that the software industry is very bad at getting
[the other half of the population](http://www.forbes.com/sites/larissafaw/2013/05/06/warren-buffett-wants-to-be-your-mentor/)
into programming. Every company should care about this.

It does not matter, if your company uses Python or JavaScript or Scala
or even Java. It does not matter what technology brings women into
programming. It just matters, that women get into
programming. [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com) has successfully
started to do this. Since 2010 the movement spreads around the
world. Your company should care about these women.

Now it is time for a new step. The
[Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org) is
here to sustain, what the women have learned in the workshops
before. The goal is to let women work fulltime on a real Open Source
software project for a period of three months. That is hopefully an
important steps for many of them to become paid software developers.

Your company can support this by
[sponsoring a pool to pay the women for their work](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/sponsors/). You
can also
[register your own Open Source project](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/)
for the event. If your company does not already support rails Girls
Summer of Code, it should definitively do!

Of course everyone can
[donate a few Dollars](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) to
the pool. And to get more impressed by the Rails Girls whatch their
promotion video:
