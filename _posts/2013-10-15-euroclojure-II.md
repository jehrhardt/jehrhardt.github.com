After an amazing first day, the second day of EuroClojure 2013 was different, but also really great.

## Narcissistic Design
The funny keynote by [Stuart Halloway](https://twitter.com/stuarthalloway), was about him, as the first slide mentioned. What we learned from him were ten simple rules, how we can make us indispensable for our employers. His advices included many useful things:

You can also read [some further notes on it](http://teropa.info/blog/2013/10/15/euroclojure-2013-narcissistic-design.html) taken by [Tero Parviainen](https://twitter.com/teropa).

## Migrating an existing code base to Clojure
The next two talks came from companies, that migrated to Clojure and shared their experiences.

First [Martin Trojer](https://twitter.com/martintrojer) from [Xively](https://xively.com) told about the Internet of Things and their cloud service. They started with Ruby on Rails, but failed. So they tried Node.js and Go and ended up with Clojure.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Ruby accidents at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23euroclojure&amp;src=hash">#euroclojure</a> <a href="http://t.co/ul3PiAZsjZ">pic.twitter.com/ul3PiAZsjZ</a></p>&mdash; Pavel (@1360g) <a href="https://twitter.com/1360g/statuses/390033432882864128">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote>

Unfortunately the talk resulted in a discussion on Twitter about Ruby bashing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>&quot;We&#39;ve got a lot of vim developers... You don&#39;t wanna force emacs on those guys&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23euroclojure&amp;src=hash">#euroclojure</a></p>&mdash; Hendrik Volkmer (@hvolkmer) <a href="https://twitter.com/hvolkmer/statuses/390036824506511360">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote>

The other migration talk came from [Daily Mail](http://dailymail.co.uk). They are serving a homepage, that is eight and a half meters long, when printed on paper. They migrated their complete application from Oracle and Java to a new Clojure code base. The best is, they did it in just six month!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>The mail online legacy code <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23euroclojure&amp;src=hash">#euroclojure</a> <a href="http://t.co/fS21CpNj6x">pic.twitter.com/fS21CpNj6x</a></p>&mdash; Jan Ehrhardt (@derjan) <a href="https://twitter.com/derjan/statuses/390042689573752832">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>The new mail online code base <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23euroclojure&amp;src=hash">#euroclojure</a> <a href="http://t.co/gIw1hQK0MU">pic.twitter.com/gIw1hQK0MU</a></p>&mdash; Jan Ehrhardt (@derjan) <a href="https://twitter.com/derjan/statuses/390050827291078657">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote>

## The lightning talks
After lunch three lightning talks were given. The first one about [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) with Emacs and OrgMode. Then there was this guy talking about [Lithium](https://github.com/nathell/lithium), which is a Lisp, that is compiled to native x86 code. Pretty amazing. The last lighting talk was a solid comparision of Clojure template engines without any winner.

## Turn the music on again
After the Creative Machines talk yesterday, we got music again on the stage. [Sam Aaron](https://twitter.com/samaaron) started his talk with live coding music right in his Emacs! [Joseph Wilk](https://twitter.com/josephwilk) recorded it and shared it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Live performance by <a href="https://twitter.com/samaaron">@samaaron</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/meta_ex">@meta_ex</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EuroClojure&amp;src=hash">#EuroClojure</a> <a href="https://t.co/83aXEmtIFf">https://t.co/83aXEmtIFf</a> Beautiful &amp; inspiring, create your own <a href="https://twitter.com/overtone">@Overtone</a> band</p>&mdash; Joseph Wilk (@josephwilk) <a href="https://twitter.com/josephwilk/statuses/390134405752434689">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote>

Sam will give a live performance at the [c-base in Berlin](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=c-base+e.V.%2C+Rungestra%C3%9Fe%2C+Berlin%2C+Deutschland&data=!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x47a84e3b41c73ea7%3A0x94a319a092a3e717!3m8!1m3!1d446029!2d13.4247317!3d52.5068441!3m2!1i1152!2i1102!4f13.1!4m2!3d52.512845!4d13.420671) on friday evening. You can watch a video of what he does on YouTube:

## Enterprise integration patterns
The last two talks were about enterprise integration, a topic I would not expect on a Clojure conference. But the talks were less borring, than expected. The speakers showed their expiriences about tools like [Storm](http://storm-project.net/) and [Lamina](https://github.com/ztellman/lamina) for integration scenarios, which was really interesting.

## Conclusion
EuroClojure 2013 was a extemely valuable event with lots of inspiring talks and fun. I am definitely looking forward to next year's EuroClojure.
