If you want to use keys longer than 256 for cryptography in Java,
you will have to install the
[JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html).
It adds support for bigger keys.

But there is a much simpler way to do this on Linux. Some distributions
like RHEL / CentOS or Ubuntu come with unlimited strength JCE build into
their own OpenJDK packages.

On Ubuntu install the OpenJDK 7 package:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless # on server
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk openjdk-7-source # on developer machine
{% endhighlight %}

On RHEL 6 / CentOS 6 install the OpenJDK 7 package this way:

{% highlight bash %}
yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk # on server
yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel # on developer machine
{% endhighlight %}

Both have unlimited encryption build in. You can verify it with a simple
