One of the most successful DevOps stories, you can find, are Platform
as a Service providers (PaaS). The companies behind
[heroku](http://heroku.com), [AppFog](http://www.appfog.com) or
[Google's App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/index) found a
way to make operations a product. A product does not mean to sell
individual service plans to different customers. Instead they sell the
same standardized product to thounsands or even millions of customers.

The most interesting feature of PaaS is, that you simply deploy your
application to the cloud and scale it as you need. While developers
are using frameworks like [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) to create
new applications, deployment is also focused on applications.

If you are thinking about applying the DevOps idea to your own
company, you should learn from the PaaS providers. Think of DevOps as
making creation and deployment of new applications as easy as
possible.
