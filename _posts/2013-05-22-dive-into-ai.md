For me it is time to learn something new, something I have never cared
about in the past. This new thing to me is
[artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).
But why do I care about it now?

Deep learning and mobile devices
--------------------------------

There are two specific reasons to me, why I start to dive into this
topic. First mobile devices have become very popular, but they are
limited. Usabillity was the trick to get around these limitations, but
it cannot solve everything. It looks like a new generation of AI could
help us to improve our usage of mobile devices. A great example is
[Android's new speech recognition](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/02/android-neural-network/),
which makes use of neural networks.

The second reason is the [Deep Learning](http://deeplearning.net)
movement, which is driven by new possibillities in creating neural
networks. It provides the hope to create algorithms, that can learn to
understand somthing really deeply. Google is doing some interessting
things in this area with it's
[Brain project](http://www.wired.com/insights/elsewhere/the-man-behind-the-google-brain-andrew-ng-and-the-quest-for-the-new-ai-20130507/).

What's hard with AI?
--------------------

While the communities around web development or agile practices are
well known and pretty active, it looks like there is not so much
public actvity around AI. There are already meetups in
[New York](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/) and the
[Silicon Valley](http://www.meetup.com/ai-silicon-valley/), but
currently none in Berlin. Although there are different activities
around AI at the universities here.

There are some open source libraries and books available for neural
networks, but looking to web development and frameworks like Ruby on
Rails, shows that we are probably just at the beginning.

Dive into AI
------------

My first step to learn about AI was to join Andrew Ng's
[machine learning class on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml).
I recommend it to everyone, who wants to get a first overview. I am
now following two strategies. First I try to learn how to use neural
networks and how to design them. In addition I have started to look
around for AI activities and people in Berlin. Maybe we will even have
an AI Berlin meetup in the future.

If you have some experiences in AI or you are simply interessted like
me, leave a comment.
