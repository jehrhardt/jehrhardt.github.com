    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is not really new, but
<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2012/06/28/Groovy+2.0+released">Groovy 2.0 is out</a>.
There is even a version
<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2012/06/28/Groovy+2.0+released">2.0.1 released</a>,
which only fixes some bugs. One of the new features introduced with
version 2.0 is support for invokedynamic. But it is not used by
default, instead you have to activate it. But there is only few
documentation and it is spread over the web. So how do we use
invokedynamic in our code?</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Get your machine ready</h2>

<p>First of all you should have installed
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java 7</a>,
since invokedynamic is not available in earlier versions of Java. The
easiest way to test invokedynamic support is by using the command
line, so should also have installed
<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download">Groovy 2.0</a> or later.</p>

<p>Having Groovy installed you could simply use it with the <em>groovy</em>
command in your terminal, but a different way, you should be familiar
with is to compile Groovy code with <em>groovyc</em> to Java byte code. The
byte code can be executed with <em>java -classpath</em>.</p>

<p><code>bash
wget -O HelloWorld.groovy https://raw.github.com/gist/3292829/f9d2a37c6cdc45570aab1bf0ce665262899a0dde/HelloWorld.java
groovyc HelloWorld.groovy
java -classpath .:$GROOVY_HOME/embeddable/groovy-all-2.0.1.jar HelloWorld
</code></p>

<p>These steps are pretty similar to my
<a href="https://gist.github.com/3292829">first steps with Java</a> years ago and
they are necessary to do your first steps with invokedynamic. But at
this time there is no invokedynamic involved.</p>

<h2>Two steps to use invokedynamic</h2>

<p>The first step on our way to invokedynamic is using the right Groovy
JAR, while executing our byte code. In <em>$GROOVY_HOME/embeddable/</em> you
can find <em>groovy-all-2.0.1-indy.jar</em>, where indy is short for
invokedynamic. This JAR contains a version of Groovy, that uses
invokedynamic instead of Groovy's very own old dynamic invoking code.</p>

<p>Using the indy JAR is not enough, since everything should still work
under Java 5 or 6, even this JAR is used. The byte code created by
Groovy compiler is not using any Java 7 features. So the second step
is to tell the <em>groovyc</em> command to compile our Groovy code using
invokedynamic by adding the <em>--indy</em> flag. The above sample should now
look like this:</p>

<p><code>bash
wget -O HelloWorld.groovy https://raw.github.com/gist/3292829/f9d2a37c6cdc45570aab1bf0ce665262899a0dde/HelloWorld.java
groovyc --indy HelloWorld.groovy
java -classpath .:$GROOVY_HOME/embeddable/groovy-all-2.0.1-indy.jar HelloWorld
</code></p>

<h2>Make your Groovy 2.0 indy</h2>

<p>Running the above code will fail at second command with a curious
exception:</p>

<p><code>
groovy.lang.GroovyRuntimeException: Cannot use invokedynamic, indy module was excluded from this build.
</code></p>

<p>What went wrong? Didn't I use Groovy 2.0? Didn't I pass the <em>--indy</em>
flag correctly? The
<a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.groovy.devel/26698">solution</a>
is simple, once you understand your Groovy installation. The Groovy
JARs used by <em>groovyc</em> are in <em>$GROOVY_HOME/lib/</em>, but the indy JARs
are in <em>$GROOVY_HOME/indy/</em>. So replace the Groovy JAR with the indy
version.</p>

<p><code>bash
cd $GROOVY_HOME
cp -R lib lib.org
cp indy/groovy-2.0.1-indy.jar lib/groovy-2.0.1.jar
</code></p>

<p>Now the above sample should work, but it really looks like the Groovy
developers do not want you to use invokedynamic. They made it as
difficult as possible, but why?</p>

<h2>Loosing previous optimizations with invokedynamic</h2>

<p>The Groovy developers have spent a lot of time to get Groovy's runtime
faster. One great step was the primitive optimization introduced with
Groovy 1.8. But these optimizations are not available if everything is
delegated to the JVM, what happens with invokedynamic.</p>

<p>You can test it using a simple
<a href="https://gist.github.com/3293383">Fibonacci sample</a>. Running the
sample on my machine with <em>fibonacci(42)</em>, the result looks like this:</p>

<p><code>
Java: 1.43s
Groovy 1.8 or 2.0: 3.08s
Groovy 2.0 with indy: 6.55s
</code></p>

<h2>It's just the first step for Groovy</h2>

<p>It is good for Groovy to support invokedynamic, but the support is not
ready yet. Some code might benefit from it, but other does
definitively not. The JVM currently does not support all optimizations
the Groovy runtime already does.</p>

<p>Making the usage of invokedynamic difficult hopefully prevents people
from using it without knowing about the impacts. So we'll see, how
well Groovy and invokedynamic will work together in future versions.</p>
